    "in the previous algorithm, I used list_p.sort() and list_p.sort(reverse=True) for sorting, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. In the optimized algorithm, I used list_p.remove() instead of list_p.sort(), which has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case. Removing an element from a list is generally faster than sorting the entire list.For each recursive call, the dominant factor is the removal of elements and the subsequent iteration through the list. The depth of the recursion is log(n), where n is the length of the original list. Therefore, the overall time complexity of my algorithm is approximately O(n log n).By replacing the sorting operations with the removal operation, I have reduced the time complexity of the algorithm. The removal operation has a lower time complexity than sorting, especially when dealing with larger lists."

    "I asked ChatGPT for final optimization, and it suggested that I eliminate the .remove() function to minimize the time complexity of my code. Instead, in the list comprehension, I need to provide an if statement to exclude the element that we want to delete. Therefore, as can be seen, by doing so, the time complexity of my algorithm will be O(n log n). The dominant factor in each recursive call is the list comprehension, which has a time complexity of O(n). The depth of the recursion is log(n), where n is the length of the original list. Therefore, the overall time complexity of my algorithm is approximately O(n log n). The dominant factor is the list comprehension within the recursion, and the rest of the operations contribute to the overall complexity."
